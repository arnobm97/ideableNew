                <p class="index-desc">Soil provides a host of crucial services for both people and the planet. Soil puts
                    food on our plates, purifies our water, protects us against flooding and combats drought. It’s also
                    key to tackling climate change as it captures and stores vast amounts of carbon. There is no food
                    security without healthy soils. Agriculture is the only essential industry but farming has one of
                    the biggest impacts on soil health. Intensive farming eliminates species living within the soil –
                    species that give soil its fertility. How we farm today is destroying our ability to feed the planet
                    in the future. We can make it more healthy</p>

                <p class="index-desc">A man who lost his hand 17 years ago has been given the sense of touch through a
                    brain-controlled robotic prosthetic.

                    Keven Walgamott, whose arm was amputated below the elbow after an accident, can now feel 119
                    different touch sensations through the prosthetic as if it were his own limb.

                    He is able to distinguish between large, small, soft and hard objects when blindfolded, and handle
                    delicate objects such as grapes and eggs. Everyday tasks such as putting on his wedding ring,
                    peeling a banana or holding a mobile phone are now possible..</p>

                <p class="index-desc">Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock. It is a form of
                    limestone composed of the mineral calcite and originally formed deep under the sea by the
                    compression of microscopic plankton that had settled to the sea floor. Chalk is common throughout
                    Western Europe, where deposits underlie parts of France, and steep cliffs are often seen where they
                    meet the sea in places such as the Dover cliffs on the Kent coast of the English Channel.

                    Chalk is mined for use in industry, such as for quicklime, bricks and builder's putty, and in
                    agriculture, for raising pH in soils with high acidity. It is also used for "blackboard chalk" for
                    writing and drawing on various types of surfaces, although these can also be manufactured from other
                    carbonate-based minerals, or gypsum</p>
