                <p class="gallery-desc">Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family
                    Accipitridae. Hawks are widely distributed and vary greatly in size.
                    The subfamily Accipitrinae includes goshawks, sparrowhawks, sharp-shinned hawks and others. This
                    subfamily are mainly woodland birds with long tails and high visual acuity. They hunt by dashing
                    suddenly from a concealed perch.</p>
